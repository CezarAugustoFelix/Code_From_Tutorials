install pip so we can install other packages
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

use this to parse a log file and generate a new one
pip3 install pynmea2
use this to print in real time gps with pyhton. Similar to cgps
pip3 install gps

python3
import pynmea2
msg = pynmea2.parse("$GPGGA,184353.07,1929.045,S,02410.506,E,1,04,2.6,100.00,M,-33.9,M,,0000*6D")
