Raspberry Pi GPS NOTES

1) INSTALL FRESH RASPBIAN ==> Download Raspberry Pi Imager and write Raspbian Lite to sd card. 
2) ENABLE SSH ==> Enable it by putting a file called ssh on the sd card before putting it in the PI

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/

3) Plug in USB GPS and find it

lsusb
Bus 001 Device 006: ID 067b:2303 Prolific Technology, Inc. PL2303 Serial Port

dmesg | grep tty

4) install GPSD and clients

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install gpsd gpsd-clients

cgps 
not working...No output from GPS receiver..

need to edit config file then restart gpsd service

sudo nano /etc/default/gpsd
DEVICES=/dev/ttyUSB0
sudo service gpsd restart
sudo service gpsd status

cgps
now its working..
now write to log file 

gpspipe -r -o output.txt
the -n 10 will print 10 lines then exit. Chnage to larger number if you want more gps data logged. 
gpspipe -r -n 10 -o output10.txt

install pip so we can install other packages
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

use this to parse a log file and generate a new one
pip3 install pynmea2

python3
import pynmea2
msg = pynmea2.parse("$GPGGA,184353.07,1929.045,S,02410.506,E,1,04,2.6,100.00,M,-33.9,M,,0000*6D")
msg

In the video, I modified the script on my local machine (since its easier for me to use an IDE) then I copied it over to the Raspberry Pi via SCP. 
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-scp-command-to-securely-transfer-files/

sample scp -
scp file.txt remote_username@10.10.0.2:/remote/directory

use this to print in real time gps with python and "gps" module. Similar to cgps
pip3 install gps
python3 library_gps.py
