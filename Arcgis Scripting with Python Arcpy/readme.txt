To get the script in the toolbox working, you will need to open the toolbox in ArcMap, right click on the SelectByLocation script and click properties.
Go to source tab and under Script File, update it to the path of the select_by_location_tool.py. 

Currently it points to where the script existed on my computer
but this will be different for you. 

Any questions reach out to me on my Youtube channel!
